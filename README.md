# QA ENGINEER PORTFOLIO - Grzegorz Adamski

### <a name="aboutme">:mag_right: ABOUT ME</a>

<p align="justify">For today I'm working in logistic as warehouseman. Additionaly I work as graphic designer. I've decided it is time for a change. <b>I thirst for knowledge and new challenges.</b> I needed a profession that allow me <b>constantly self-develop</b>. And that's how I changed my life, choosing to be a <b>QA Engineer</b>.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Why do I love being a tester?</b> Testing is an endless opportunity to find typos, logical errors or functionalities that can work better and easier. Another plus of being a tester is using my <b>creativity</b>. I always <b>try to find a new way to "break" something in the software or use it unusually</b>. I always try to <b>put myself in someone else's shoes and look at software through their eyes</b>. I also care about other colleagues, so I try to write test cases so that the reproduction of the steps comes easily.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>What are my skills?</b> During my course, I have learned <b>SQL, Chrome DevTools, Jira, Postman, GIT</b> and <b>white/black box methods</b>.</p>
